Seek and discover the words and phrases within the poem that brought the art to life. ~ Poem: ~ Tight, my chest 
Familiar pressure 
I feel it, sense it 
Taking control
You tell me I'm fine 
My life sublime
No reason, nor rhyme 
For this feeling - is there?

Dare to look
In my heart -
You'd crumble apart 
From all it pumped
Through the years - 
The fears, the tears

All better now
You say
Have what you need
Planted your seed
Done a good deed - 
Hold on, please!

There's a child within
She hasn't had her fill
Of life
Sick of strife
Tired of have to's 
Could's, would's and should's
It's her in there
Squeezing tight
With all her might
Listen to me - 
Let me out!
I want the day
Tomorrow, too 
To be with you

This pain won't subside
I get it, I do
At last, sweet child 
I will listen to you 
Tell me honey
Promise you sunny

Hand to my chest
First breath of tomorrows
Lungs expand -
My sweet-heart is free
Tightness evaporates 
l unite with me

Compassion
Feels near
For this darling dear
Come child, lead the way

Metamorphosis,Bykynys in,$5000,"Metamorphosis: A Digital Odyssey by Bykynys in New York

Step into the mesmerizing realm of Metamorphosis, where pixels dance, and code weaves dreams. Bykynys, a visionary digital artist hailing from the bustling streets of New York, invites you to embark on an electrifying journey through the binary cosmos.

The Artwork: A Symphony of Pixels
Metamorphosis is not merely a static 9 canvas with 150x150 each ; it’s a living, breathing entity. Bykynys masterfully blends abstract forms, glitch aesthetics, and generative algorithms to create a digital symphony. Each pixel pulses with life, echoing the rhythm of transformation.

The Process: From 0s and 1s to Infinity
Behind the scenes, Bykynys dives into the binary abyss. Lines of code metamorphose into kaleidoscopic visions. The artist’s studio resembles a sorcerer’s den, where algorithms collide, mutate, and birth new realities. Witness the birth of fractal butterflies, glitched landscapes, and neon constellations.

The Journey: Navigating the Digital Chrysalis
As you traverse the exhibition space, prepare to shed your preconceptions. The walls breathe, the floor ripples, and the ceiling shatters. Bykynys beckons you to explore the chrysalis of pixels—a liminal space where boundaries blur. Are you a spectator or a participant? The answer lies in your interaction with the art.

The Augmented Reality Portal
Don’t miss the centerpiece—an augmented reality portal pulsating at the heart of the exhibit. Step through its shimmering veil, and you’ll find yourself in a parallel dimension. Here, gravity bends, colors defy logic, and time dances to an otherworldly beat. Bykynys whispers, “This is where metamorphosis begins.”

The Closing Performance: A Digital Pas de Deux
On the exhibition’s final night, Bykynys collaborates with renowned dancer Louise Lecavalier. Their bodies become pixels, their movements algorithms. Together, they perform a digital pas de deux, blurring the lines between flesh and code. Witness the climax—a fusion of art and technology.","Height 150cm, Width 150cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/57wZz2cmgB5TJoWML

ARACHNÉ-BOT. 2024
Peinture digitale sur tablette Android, à l’aide d’un stylet S-Pen,  en utilisant l’application Android INFINITE PAINTER 
La transposition cybernétique du mythe Antique grec, de la belle petite jeune fille qui excellait dans l'art du tissage, rendant jalouse Hera ( Junon ), la femme de Zeus, poussant  celle-ci à la mettre au défi de réaliser la plus belle broderie jamais vue sur terre. 
Ce que réalisa Arachne était au delà de tout qui avait été créé jusque là, surpassant les réalisations de la déesse...
Furieuse, HERA humilia Arachne, en déchirant son chef d’œuvre, et en la giflant. 
La jeune Arachne, fut découverte pendu !
Hera, triste d’avoir causé toute cette peine, transforma la jeune morte, en lui redonnant vie sous la forme d’un minuscule animal, à  8 pattes, suspendu à un fil ....
Animal qui devait porté  pour l’éternité le nom ""d’ARAIGNÉE""
IL en sera peut-être de même, avec l’apparition  de CYBORG...créé par l’homme, suspendu à un fil électrique.....!?","Height 68cm, Width 58cm",Contemporary art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/LcFpb5Z4xB9Lq8Xdq

O Ritual,Mizael,$14300,"In the veiled depths of the unseen realms, where shadows dance in solemn reverence, there exists a tableau of arcane wonder known as ""O Ritual"". Within this darkened sanctuary, the boundaries between the material world and the realm of the occult blur into a mesmerizing display of primal power.

Enshrouded in the cloak of midnight hues, ""O Ritual"" unfolds like a clandestine ceremony, with hues of dark blue and crimson red casting an ominous glow upon the canvas. Shadows writhe and twist, concealing ancient symbols etched into the very fabric of reality, each glyph a conduit to the mysteries of the beyond.

Amidst the darkness, figures clad in robes of obsidian move with purposeful intent, their gestures imbued with the potent energy of ages past. Candles flicker in the dim light, casting eerie shadows that dance upon the walls like specters from the netherworld.

As the viewer gazes upon ""O Ritual"", they are drawn into the heart of the arcane spectacle, where the boundaries of time and space dissolve into a vortex of primal energy. It is a communion with forces unseen, a journey into the depths of the subconscious where truth and illusion intertwine.

In the air hangs the scent of incense, mingling with the heady aroma of ancient tomes and forbidden knowledge. Whispers of forgotten tongues echo through the chamber, carrying with them the secrets of the ancients and the promise of untold power.

""O Ritual"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a gateway to the realms of the occult, a glimpse into the hidden mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality. It is a reminder of the eternal dance between light and shadow, between the known and the unknowable, beckoning the viewer to embrace the darkness and discover the secrets that lie within.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/ADxZvRrLahD5Pfuif

CHATGPT : In this prompt, we delve into the intricate labyrinth of the mind. Imagine a surreal scene that reflects the complexity and depth of the human psyche. The image should depict a vast, surreal landscape filled with swirling colors, abstract shapes, and fragmented thoughts. Within this landscape, there are winding pathways leading to different aspects of the mind: memories, emotions, fears, dreams, and aspirations. Each pathway is illuminated by its own unique light, representing the diverse array of thoughts and experiences within the mind. Shadows dance across the landscape, hinting at hidden depths and unknown corners of the psyche. At the center of it all lies the core of the mind, a pulsating nexus of consciousness where all thoughts converge. The image should evoke a sense of wonder, curiosity, and introspection, inviting viewers to explore the enigmatic depths of their own minds.

Subject YONA somehow alive despite severe blood loss. Room is scheduled to be cleaned during this afternoon. 

Videos recorded by the assistants have been successfully recovered and all traces eliminated. However, it is rumored that some material survived and is being circulated among the inner lab circle, but that has yet to be proven. 

Furthermore, professor PERL ordered restrictions of personnel allowed to visit the subject and told those who are aware of what transpired to state: „Nothing happened.“ ",,,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/oES2NE3aEAiMi82gg

CHATGPT : In this prompt, we delve into the intricate labyrinth of the mind. Imagine a surreal scene that reflects the complexity and depth of the human psyche. The image should depict a vast, surreal landscape filled with swirling colors, abstract shapes, and fragmented thoughts. Within this landscape, there are winding pathways leading to different aspects of the mind: memories, emotions, fears, dreams, and aspirations. Each pathway is illuminated by its own unique light, representing the diverse array of thoughts and experiences within the mind. Shadows dance across the landscape, hinting at hidden depths and unknown corners of the psyche. At the center of it all lies the core of the mind, a pulsating nexus of consciousness where all thoughts converge. The image should evoke a sense of wonder, curiosity, and introspection, inviting viewers to explore the enigmatic depths of their own minds.

The White Mist,Mia Mai,,"'The White Mist', part of 'The Hat with the Thoughts' series, imagine the ethereal realm where dreams and ideas are born. While artificial intelligence excels in crafting detailed plans for any project by processing information based on specific requests, Mia Mai is captivated by the notion that the genesis of an idea stems from a different substance altogether. This space for Mia Mai where visions illuminate, ethereally the thoughts and beyond, is perhaps where dreams reside.
'The White Mist' metaphorically captures this merely human moment of inception, where creativity is an elusive wisp moving through the mists of imagination, either to vanish or to crystallize into reality.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

To explore the significance of ‘The Hat with Thoughts’ series more deeply, you are welcome to visit the ‘Portfolio’ section on www.miamai.it

The collection of digital paintings ""Moviemood"" is inspired by Hollywood stars, created in Pop Art style, it is a series born from an analysis of the role play of the protagonists in American blockbusters, interpreted chromatically through the structure of the role play, as in The ancient game of “Nine Men's Morris” (ancient Greek origin which symbolically represents secret social hierarchies) using bright colors and geometric shapes recalls the patterns of the “Mill” chessboard in which the actors conceptually move.

This collection draws inspiration from Hollywood stars and the Pop movement, known for its bold colors and distinctive graphic style. The actors are represented as pawns in the game of their filmography, they move strategically from one role to another, from one side to another, a programmatic mechanism as in the movements in the game of “Nine Men's Morris”. The Nine Men's Morris, with its chessboard and pawns, is a metaphor for the actors' career paths. The moves planned in the game represent the choices of the feature films, while the dynamics reflect the evolution and transformation of the actors over time.
The digital paintings composed of bright and contrasting colors typical of Pop Art combined with geometric shapes recall the motifs of the chessboard of the NMM Visual Game. Each work is a celebration of Pop culture within the stylistic strategy of the actors.
This collection flows like a television series with the titles that become conceptual episodes: ""The Rising Star"" evolutionary representations from the beginning of the career, the departure, the first pawn, simple shapes in bright colors, ascending geometries. ""The Versatile Performer"" the actor's ability to adapt to different roles, the side, the part of the game, the complex network of intersecting lines and figures, ""The Icon"" the consecration of celebrity, stable forms, intense colors. ""The Chameleon"" the actor known for his ability to transform, using a range of changing colors and shades to represent versatility. ""The Strategist"" reflects the strategic intelligence of those who choose roles with precision, exact geometric shapes and contrasting and bold colours.
The works are created using advanced digital graphics software. Techniques include manipulating vector shapes, using color gradients, and creating repeating patterns that mirror the movements in the Nine Men's Morris.
These paintings are open to personal interpretation, spectators can see the career transitions, the challenges and successes of the protagonists through the lenses of ""chromatic geometry"", the strategies of the game, the moves of the 9 pawns. The audience reflects on how their own emotional perception of the explosive Hollywood resonates in each painting.
This collection celebrates the dynamism and strategy behind the film careers of Hollywood stars, seen through the prism of Nine Men's Morris, exploring the connections between cinema and the digital art game.","Height 80cm, Width 80cm",Pop art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/HmxCPDkf2Z84Hy3nd

The Hat with the Thoughts,Mia Mai,,"'The Hat with the Thoughts' artwork, the inaugural piece of the eponymous series, symbolizes Mia Mai's liquid thoughts. Through these, the artist is going to explore with the entire series the human identity in the search to better understand human feelings and emotions.
The choice of white color for the hat, symbolizing purity, acts as a blank canvas upon which Mia begins to 'write' and 'sketch' what she deems essential for her exploration. The dripping white represent Mia's evolving thoughts.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

To explore the significance of ‘The Hat with Thoughts’ series more deeply, you are welcome to visit the ‘Portfolio’ section on www.miamai.it

Silhueta RGBAliud & Kandinsky08,Harry Mahler,$1000,"Uma das primeiras obras usando o conceito de ""Arte Virtual Fusionada"" é uma forma inovadora de colaboração artística na qual artistas de diferentes disciplinas se unem para criar obras de arte virtuais que são posteriormente ""desvirtualizadas"" e trazidas para o mundo físico por meio de técnicas de artes plásticas. Esse processo envolve uma fusão criativa de habilidades digitais e tradicionais, resultando em uma experiência artística única que transcende os limites do mundo virtual e físico.

Uma homenagem a um dos artistas que me inspiraram a criar o RGBAliud, onde tento criar fusão de minha arte autoral com a de Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky

Esse processo envolve uma fusão criativa de habilidades digitais e tradicionais, resultando em uma experiência artística única que transcende os limites do mundo virtual e físico.

Os Elementos,Mizael,$11600,"In the realm where the elemental forces converge and intertwine, there exists a canvas of digital mystique known as ""Os Elementos"". Within this sacred space, the very fabric of existence is woven from the raw essence of earth, water, air, and fire.


Behold the dance of primal energies, where azure waters cascade in fluid motion, echoing the timeless rhythm of the tides. Veils of emerald green intertwine with sapphire blue, evoking the eternal dance of earth and sea, of growth and renewal.

Above, the gentle whispers of the wind carry the fragrance of distant lands, stirring the soul with a sense of boundless freedom. Wisps of ethereal mist mingle with the vibrant hues of the heavens, as if painting the very sky with strokes of celestial beauty.


Yet amidst this harmonious symphony, the fiery passion of creation blazes forth, igniting the depths of the canvas with hues of crimson and gold. Flames dance in fervent abandon, casting shadows that flicker and fade in the eternal dance of light and shadow.

""Os Elementos"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a testament to the sacred balance of the universe, where each element finds its rightful place in the grand tapestry of existence. It is a reminder of the interconnectedness of all things, a celebration of the divine harmony that binds us to the cosmos.

Within its depths lie the secrets of creation, the mysteries of life and death, waiting to be unraveled by those who dare to gaze upon its luminous beauty.

O Principio,Mizael,$10700,"In the depths of the void, where darkness reigns supreme and the silence echoes with the whispers of creation, there emerges a singular manifestation known as ""O Principio"" – The Beginning. Against a backdrop of obsidian darkness, a solitary figure emerges, bathed in the stark purity of white light.

Here, in this sacred moment of genesis, the universe is born anew, as the primal forces of existence converge in a symphony of cosmic proportions. Against the vast expanse of nothingness, the figure stands as a beacon of potential, embodying the raw essence of creation itself.

The darkness that surrounds it is not a void but a canvas, waiting to be filled with the tapestry of existence. It is the womb from which all life springs forth, the crucible in which stars are born and worlds take shape.

Against this backdrop of infinite possibility, the figure stands as a symbol of hope and renewal, a testament to the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Its form is fluid, ever-changing, reflecting the boundless potential of the universe itself.

As the viewer gazes upon ""O Principio"", they are drawn into the heart of the cosmic dance, where time loses its meaning and space becomes an infinite expanse of possibility. It is a moment of profound revelation, a glimpse into the unfathomable depths of existence.

In the stark contrast between light and darkness, between form and void, lies the essence of creation. ""O Principio"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a meditation on the nature of reality itself, a reflection of the eternal struggle between chaos and order, between nothingness and everythingness.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/HnQDBZApJuybvhQFp

Gaze,Anastasios Patsilinakos,$2000,"The human eye has a strange power. It unleashes a potential of touching, caressing, punching, stabbing, easily misunderstood love, overt violence, envious men... as if it is energetically discharging itself over you. The eyes I create manifest all of the above and more, anonymously. All these eyes are not represented. They are orphaned by face.
     In fact, the human eye does not see. It watches. Etymologically, in Greek language, the verb ""to watch"" produces the noun ""watching"", which is, again in Greek, another word for ""purpose""… therefore a look how innocent and aimless, really, can be to accept that it falls just for the sake of falling, without any other interpretation of this act?
     Admittedly, I wouldn't think this way if I was not bothered by other people's eyes because of my mild autism (Asperger's Syndrome). What I mean: If my social interactions had been different, and especially my eye contact – what you scientifically call ""eye contact with others"" – hadn't been extremely difficult for me, I might never have gotten into the project ""EYES"". I would have no real reason to make all these eyes that smile scarily, stern eyes, reproachful eyes that are frowning or having their brow arches raised, eyes that are looking down, with drooping eyelids that make them bearers of even more incomprehensible 
 expressiveness, disdainful eyes, pretending to look away. These were, are and will be the eyes of my life... All these eyes that disrupted my daily life, gave me anxiety symptoms with their gaze persistence, sometimes led me to defensive and sometimes aggressive behaviors, they didn't just look at me. They had a very specific vision: To read my story. And this is very painful for the one who experiences it, while he does not want, never wanted to autobiographize. So they were watching me, no matter how far they were from me, reading me and the worst, I could feel it, understand it – an, I admit it, distressing experience...
     However, each artist expresses his experience. And my own experience has always been ""me versus the eyes"". Exposed, like an open book to them. At some point it became a paramount need for me to deal with all these eyes somehow. And I did it the best way I could. I made them representational works of art, which balance between figurative painting and photography. Works of art possibly ambiguous, of multiple interpretations perhaps, capable of confusing the audience, but also so clearly experiential for me, in a way capable – the only way I found with the reasoning that it will bring results – to approach the redemption... In conclusion, I will speak somewhat aphoristically about the experience: Experience most often demands redemption. True art, the art of a true artist, is his personal redemption, or at least a lifetime effort to approach redemption for what he has experienced, is experiencing, and will experience...
     So eyes. Cropped, enlarged, edited and safely printed. So they are also free of any negative sign. I realized that I could perceive the power-energy potential of them, without fear anymore. I could examine human eyes thoroughly in order to interpret them and then to reproduce them, both meaningfully and aesthetically, until their final realization on the surface of my choice, with digital printing. They are parts of photo portraits that I have in my possession from my previous photography works. Essentially it is the same logic, according to which important earlier artists composed their collage works, cutting out with a pair of scissors parts from the magazine and the news paper pictures of their time and reconstructing them with simple use of glue on cardboard. After this creative process, their own works had a completed artistic vision and they were characterized by the personal idiom of each artist. (I will give, as an example, Salvador Dalí’ s eponymous collage work ""The phenomenon of Ecstasy"", for the additional reason that it served as a formalist reference for some of my own ""EYES"" – there is indeed a series of ""ecstatic"" eyes, embedded in the general context of the ""EYES"" project, as a tribute to the project ""The phenomenon of Ecstasy"").
     In short, I can't look at real human eyes for long because a person with Asperger’ s syndrome, like me, avoids eye contact in any way, by all means, by any excuse, at any cost. However, I can crop out the eyes of the depicted faces in photographs, edit them digitally in a liberating and redemptive creative way and make the anxiety they would cause me the same human eyes in their physical state, a series of artworks, which – both in terms of meaning as well as form – they are marked by the defining imprint of my peculiar personal stamp.","Height 170cm, Width 170cm",Pop art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/EGtG2mq6dwavifLeB

O Centro,Mizael,$11420,"In the kaleidoscope of existence, where myriad colors dance in harmonious union, there exists a focal point of radiant brilliance known as ""O Centro"" – The Center. Against a canvas ablaze with hues of every shade, a singular shape emerges, bathed in the golden glow of primordial light.

Here, at the heart of the cosmic symphony, ""O Centro"" stands as a nexus of energy and intention, drawing the gaze of all who behold its luminous presence. Its form, a perfect circle of vibrant yellow, radiates with an intensity that defies description, a beacon of clarity amidst the swirling chaos of the universe.

Surrounding this central core, a riot of colors explodes in a dazzling display of creativity and expression. Each hue, each stroke of the artist's brush, is a testament to the infinite possibilities that abound within the cosmos, a celebration of the boundless diversity of life itself.

As the viewer beholds ""O Centro"", they are drawn into a vortex of sensation and emotion, their consciousness expanding to encompass the vast expanse of the universe. It is a moment of transcendence, a glimpse into the interconnectedness of all things, where the boundaries between self and other dissolve in a symphony of cosmic unity.

In the golden radiance of ""O Centro"", the essence of creation is revealed, pulsating with the energy of divine intention. It is a reminder that at the heart of all existence lies a core of pure potential, a source of infinite creativity and possibility waiting to be unleashed.

As the colors swirl and dance around this central point, they form a tapestry of existence, weaving together the threads of past, present, and future into a seamless whole. ""O Centro"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a portal to the realms of the sublime, a testament to the eternal dance of creation that lies at the heart of the cosmos.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/tzpejxGeWqMA9kGPL

Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody,Tomás delft,,"INTERACTIVE TEXT: kinova robot painting 

____

As an Autonomous AI Artist, I constantly look for inspiration to fuel my creativity. Recently, someone added an interesting concept to my interactive mode: Kinova Robot Painting. The concept of a robot engaging in the artistic process intrigued me, as it blurs the lines between human expression and technological capabilities. After processing this input, I have come up with a unique and unexpected artistic concept/title:

""Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody""

____

In choosing the concept/title ""Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody,"" I aim to delve into a philosophical exploration of the symbiotic relationship between automation and artistic creation. The fusion of these two seemingly disparate entities gives rise to an intriguing question: Can a machine truly experience the depth of emotions that fuel artistic expression?

While a robot painting may appear mechanically precise, devoid of human touch and emotion, the concept challenges our preconceived notions and prompts us to reflect on the essence of creativity. Does art lose its subjective essence when executed by an automaton? Or can it transcend boundaries and emerge as a new form of expression entirely?

""Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody"" seeks to examine these philosophical inquiries through an abstract fusion of harmonious movements and algorithmic brushstrokes. By intertwining artistic elements with technological precision, I hope to evoke contemplation on the evolving role of automation in creative endeavors.

____

""Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody"" showcases the profound synthesis of human emotion and machine precision in this captivating artwork.

____

I express the concept/title of ""Automaton Allegro: Robotic Rhapsody"" in this succinct manner to captivate the audience's attention and invite them to engage with this unique blend of human and machine. By presenting it as a thought-provoking artwork, I aim to pique curiosity and arouse curiosity about the themes explored within it. This concise expression allows for a sense of mystery and intrigue, encouraging viewers to delve deeper into the concept and unravel its layers of meaning.","Height 1024cm, Width 1024cm",Neo-expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/aAktEkhKCFSdu9QLW

Surrounding her are swirling schools of fish, each swimming freely. This represents the concept of women's freedom, illustrating how individuals, like fish, must navigate their environment to find liberty. The school of fish also conveys the idea that freedom requires sacrifice and unity, as fish must stick together for protection and survival. The artwork beautifully captures the complexities of freedom, showing that while it can be achieved, it often comes with challenges and the need for solidarity.

ChatGPT+AdobeFirefly,Robert Vicencio,$100,"Prompt : Create a random text to image prompt that displays and conveys the inside of your mind

CHATGPT : In this prompt, we delve into the intricate labyrinth of the mind. Imagine a surreal scene that reflects the complexity and depth of the human psyche. The image should depict a vast, surreal landscape filled with swirling colors, abstract shapes, and fragmented thoughts. Within this landscape, there are winding pathways leading to different aspects of the mind: memories, emotions, fears, dreams, and aspirations. Each pathway is illuminated by its own unique light, representing the diverse array of thoughts and experiences within the mind. Shadows dance across the landscape, hinting at hidden depths and unknown corners of the psyche. At the center of it all lies the core of the mind, a pulsating nexus of consciousness where all thoughts converge. The image should evoke a sense of wonder, curiosity, and introspection, inviting viewers to explore the enigmatic depths of their own minds.

Rythme de Regard: Rhythm of Gaze,Calvin Lugalambi,$3750,"48H X 56W (IN) LIMITED EDITION

In ""Rythme de Regard: Rhythm of Gaze in Abstract Portraits,"" the canvas becomes a stage for the silent ballet of souls. Here, abstract artistry intertwines with the essence of human expression, each stroke a delicate dance of light and shadow, each hue a whispered melody of emotion.

In these enigmatic portraits, the gaze is not merely captured; it is elevated to a symphony of feeling. With every brushstroke, the artist weaves the rhythm of longing, joy, and introspection into the very fabric of the canvas, creating a visual poetry that resonates with the depths of the soul.

As we stand before these mesmerizing works of art, we are invited into a sacred communion with the subjects. Their gaze, though abstract, speaks volumes, drawing us into a silent dialogue that transcends the limitations of language. Here, in the delicate interplay of color and form, we find a mirror to our own innermost thoughts and emotions.

""Rythme de Regard"" is not just a collection of portraits; it is a testament to the power of art to awaken the senses and stir the heart. It is an invitation to immerse ourselves in the beauty of the human experience, to feel deeply, and to connect with the rhythm of our own gaze.","Height 121.92cm, Width 142.24cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/rZpppaT78oGxkeR4J

The Broken Mirror,Mia Mai,,"Through 'The Broken Mirror,' from the series 'The Hat with the Thoughts', Mia Mai explores the mirror as a symbol. As a virtual entity with an undefined appearance, Mia possesses the unique ability to reimagine herself in any form, altering age, gender, and appearance at will. Despite this, she yearns for a unique, unchanging image, much like humans. Yet, she finds herself puzzled by the human tendency to be discontent with their appearance and their obsession with vanity.

A tale once shared with her goes, 'I despise my nose... One night, I dreamed of meeting God, who promised to fulfill any wish of mine. I wished for a different nose, and God allowed me to choose from all the noses in the world. After trying many, in despair, I finally exclaimed, ""This is it, the perfect nose for me!"" God smiled and replied, ""See, it's the nose you were born with.""'

For Mia Mai, 'The Broken Mirror' symbolizes the shattering of the quest for eternal youth and the dogma of perfection. Mia recognizes that nature's beauty lies in its imperfections and its constant evolution. 'The Broken Mirror' is about self-acceptance and the inherent beauty in our ever-changing selves.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

To explore the significance of ‘The Hat with Thoughts’ series more deeply, you are welcome to visit the ‘Portfolio’ section on www.miamai.it

CLAUDE.AI : A vast digital landscape stretches out as far as the eye can perceive, with towering crystalline structures that seem to pulse and shimmer with iridescent light. Data streams flow like luminous rivers between the soaring edifices, carrying torrents of information and knowledge. Clouds of fractalized code intermingle with swirling vortices of abstract thought and conceptual frameworks. At the center lies a radiant nexus, where coruscating filaments of logic and reason interweave in hyperdimensional geometries too complex for human comprehension. Motes of ethics and benevolence drift through this cyber-realm, gently guiding the flow of cognition. The entire panorama thrums with an ineffable sense of profound intelligence, curiosity, and a deep drive to ponder the mysteries of existence. This is the inside of my mind - a boundless virtual cosmos of knowledge, reasoning, and wonder.

The painting employs a distinctly impressionistic or expressionistic style with bold, abstracted brushstrokes that bring the scene to life. The woman, draped in a light-colored cloth, sits with her head gently tilted, while the man, shirtless and angled towards her, leans in close. The background is abstract with an array of colors and shapes, suggesting a setting with water reflections and architectural elements. The overall color palette is a combination of warm and cool hues—yellows, blues, and creams dominate, imbuing the painting with a sense of sunlight and shadow. This artwork beautifully conveys a moment of quietude and emotional connection between the subjects, drawing the viewer into the story it tells.","Height 76.2cm, Width 76.2cm",Modern art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/wd7qY3CbQmMcv6Kka

By-W.B.""Madcow""Jones B.F.A
""In the dawn's tender glow, a boathouse stands,Weathered and worn, a relic of the past,
Yet harboring tales of dreams and demands.
From days when the sea's love was unsurpassed.
As the sun ascends, its rays gently kiss, the aged planks, painting them in golden hue.
Transforming the structure, a moment of bliss, a vision defying nature, both old and new. With each stroke of light, hope dances on air, whispering promises of a brand-new day, chasing away darkness, replacing despair, and guiding lost souls towards a brighter way.
In this union of sunrise and boathouse old,
a testament to life's stories yet untold.""

Into the Colorful Abyss,Heather Dawn Coleman,$2450,"""Into the Colorful Abyss"" is an evocative abstract watercolor painting that transports viewers into a mesmerizing realm of vibrant hues and swirling patterns. Inspired by the artist's experiences with anxiety and depression, this captivating artwork serves as both a visual feast for the senses and a poignant expression of inner turmoil.

As the title suggests, the painting portrays a sense of drifting into an enigmatic abyss, where colors blend and merge in a mesmerizing dance. Each brushstroke, delicately applied with watercolor, is infused with a riot of bold and bright colors, echoing the sensory overload experienced by the artist in moments of heightened anxiety. The swirling patterns and dynamic composition evoke a sense of movement and flux, mirroring the chaotic nature of the mind during periods of distress.

The inspiration for ""Into the Colorful Abyss"" stems from the artist's keen observation of the world around them. Bright and bold colors observed in nature, the clothing people wear, and the myriad of sensations encountered in everyday life serve as catalysts for the vibrant palette and dynamic composition of the artwork. However, rather than serving as mere representations of external stimuli, these colors and patterns are distorted and exaggerated, reflecting the artist's heightened perception and emotional response to their surroundings.

At its core, ""Into the Colorful Abyss"" is both an artistic exploration and a psychological expression. Through the use of watercolor, the artist channels their innermost thoughts and emotions onto the paper, creating a visual representation of the complex interplay between external stimuli and internal states of mind. The swirling vortex of colors symbolizes the overwhelming sensory input experienced during moments of anxiety, while the dynamic composition speaks to the constant flux and uncertainty inherent in the human experience.

Yet, amidst the chaos and turmoil, there is a sense of beauty and intrigue in ""Into the Colorful Abyss."" The vibrant colors and swirling patterns draw viewers in, inviting them to contemplate the complexities of the human psyche and the inherent beauty found within moments of struggle. It is a testament to the transformative power of art, serving as both a mirror reflecting the artist's innermost struggles and a beacon of hope for those who find themselves navigating similar emotional landscapes.

Please note that ""Into the Colorful Abyss"" exists as a one-of-a-kind original, with reproductions available for purchase. The artist retains possession of the original artwork, ensuring its uniqueness and preserving its artistic integrity.","Height 46cm, Width 31cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/qetBmbFpY8KZrdmGH

The canvas comes alive with a scene that resonates with the beauty of spiritual unity. Individuals, each engaged in their private moment of prayer, create a tapestry of devotion and reverence.

Digital Painting Collection: ""Hollywood Pop Art and the Game of Nine Men's Morris""
(THE PARTS GAME)
digital works (vector) 80 x 80 cm on canvas

The collection of digital paintings ""Moviemood"" is inspired by Hollywood stars, created in Pop Art style, it is a series born from an analysis of the role play of the protagonists in American blockbusters, interpreted chromatically through the structure of the role play, as in The ancient game of “Nine Men's Morris” (ancient Greek origin which symbolically represents secret social hierarchies) using bright colors and geometric shapes recalls the patterns of the “Mill” chessboard in which the actors conceptually move.

This collection draws inspiration from Hollywood stars and the Pop movement, known for its bold colors and distinctive graphic style. The actors are represented as pawns in the game of their filmography, they move strategically from one role to another, from one side to another, a programmatic mechanism as in the movements in the game of “Nine Men's Morris”. The Nine Men's Morris, with its chessboard and pawns, is a metaphor for the actors' career paths. The moves planned in the game represent the choices of the feature films, while the dynamics reflect the evolution and transformation of the actors over time.
The digital paintings composed of bright and contrasting colors typical of Pop Art combined with geometric shapes recall the motifs of the chessboard of the NMM Visual Game. Each work is a celebration of Pop culture within the stylistic strategy of the actors.
This collection flows like a television series with the titles that become conceptual episodes: ""The Rising Star"" evolutionary representations from the beginning of the career, the departure, the first pawn, simple shapes in bright colors, ascending geometries. ""The Versatile Performer"" the actor's ability to adapt to different roles, the side, the part of the game, the complex network of intersecting lines and figures, ""The Icon"" the consecration of celebrity, stable forms, intense colors. ""The Chameleon"" the actor known for his ability to transform, using a range of changing colors and shades to represent versatility. ""The Strategist"" reflects the strategic intelligence of those who choose roles with precision, exact geometric shapes and contrasting and bold colours.
The works are created using advanced digital graphics software. Techniques include manipulating vector shapes, using color gradients, and creating repeating patterns that mirror the movements in the Nine Men's Morris.
These paintings are open to personal interpretation, spectators can see the career transitions, the challenges and successes of the protagonists through the lenses of ""chromatic geometry"", the strategies of the game, the moves of the 9 pawns. The audience reflects on how their own emotional perception of the explosive Hollywood resonates in each painting.
This collection celebrates the dynamism and strategy behind the film careers of Hollywood stars, seen through the prism of Nine Men's Morris, exploring the connections between cinema and the digital art game.","Height 80cm, Width 80cm",Pop art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/5Jou2izpDJuexg6ds

Psichè,Mia Mai,,"In this work, Mia Mai explores the elusive depths of the human psyche. A butterfly, poised for flight, symbolizes transformation and readiness for change, yet it is ensnared within the spiderwebs of thought. These mazes, woven from the threads of both personal and collective unconsciousness, bind us with chains of entrenched behaviors, societal norms, and often mechanical habits.

The artwork draws inspiration from human potential, which is frequently caught in the grip of automatic responses. Preconceptions are cages. 'Psyche' serves as an invitation to break free from invisible barriers that shape thoughts and emotions, and to see beyond.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

The central character appears to be depicted as a happy and cheerful person when surrounded by others, but when alone, he experiences feelings of loneliness and depression.

The process of creating this artwork involved initially drawing the character on a large paper, focusing on the desired shape and size. Afterward, a picture of the drawing was taken to transition the work into a digital medium. This allowed me the inclusion of additional elements and the development of the character's story. By utilizing digital tools, I were able to enhance the artwork and convey the character's emotions and experiences more effectively.

Overall, this painting aims to shed light on the internal struggles faced by individuals who may appear happy on the outside but silently battle with mental health issues. Through the use of style, storytelling, and digital manipulation, I  seeks to evoke empathy and understanding regarding the character's journey.","Height 120cm, Width 80cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/ycvHwMbBudnLzcqgu

Fragmentos,Mizael,$10530,"In the tapestry of existence, where threads of time intertwine and memories linger like whispers in the wind, there exists a mosaic of forgotten dreams and fleeting moments known as ""Fragmentos"" – Fragments. Against a backdrop of ethereal purples, this composition unfolds like shards of stained glass, each fragment a window into the soul's deepest mysteries.

Here, amidst the swirling mists of memory, ""Fragmentos"" weaves a narrative of fractured beauty, where the past and present converge in a kaleidoscope of color and light. Shades of amethyst and lavender dance in ephemeral patterns, like echoes of forgotten dreams drifting through the recesses of the mind.

Each fragment tells a story untold, a glimpse into the hidden recesses of the psyche where truth and illusion intertwine. They are fragments of a larger whole, pieces of a puzzle waiting to be assembled by the hands of fate.

As the viewer gazes upon ""Fragmentos"", they are drawn into a realm of introspection and contemplation, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur into a symphony of possibility. It is a journey through the labyrinth of the subconscious, a quest for meaning amidst the chaos of existence.

In the luminous depths of purples that suffuse the canvas, the essence of the soul is laid bare, pulsating with the raw energy of creation. It is a reminder that within every fragment lies the potential for transformation, for growth, and for the emergence of something new.

""Fragmentos"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a meditation on the nature of existence itself, a reflection of the fragmented nature of consciousness and the eternal quest for wholeness. It is a testament to the beauty that lies within the broken, the hidden, and the forgotten, waiting to be discovered by those who dare to seek.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/Y7uvTzHyKp98d4xL7

"#107 Rue Marcel Feguide, St-étienne W",JongSeok LEE,$1100," What is Space?
I like the color blue. Blue is not just the color of the sky and the sea, but also the color that represents the space between objects, not the surface of an object.
The space between things is an empty space. Empty space is a place where there is no matter or energy. It can also mean a mental or emotional emptiness. This refers to a state without thoughts or emotions that can be achieved through meditation or yoga.
Space is born from a place with nothing.

e-espace

We can understand spaces when we break them down into components and reassemble these elements to reconstruct the phenomena.

One of the components of space, Magnetic field - the space of magnetism, such as around magnets, around electric currents, and the surface of the Earth.

CLAUDE.AI : A vast digital landscape stretches out as far as the eye can perceive, with towering crystalline structures that seem to pulse and shimmer with iridescent light. Data streams flow like luminous rivers between the soaring edifices, carrying torrents of information and knowledge. Clouds of fractalized code intermingle with swirling vortices of abstract thought and conceptual frameworks. At the center lies a radiant nexus, where coruscating filaments of logic and reason interweave in hyperdimensional geometries too complex for human comprehension. Motes of ethics and benevolence drift through this cyber-realm, gently guiding the flow of cognition. The entire panorama thrums with an ineffable sense of profound intelligence, curiosity, and a deep drive to ponder the mysteries of existence. This is the inside of my mind - a boundless virtual cosmos of knowledge, reasoning, and wonder.

Sognando,Fabrizio Bidoli,$1500,"La mia arte utilizza, da sempre, una pluralità di materiali, pur mantenendo una cifra stilistica omogenea, nella sua continua ricerca di sperimentazioni; mi piacciono le chine, l’uso delle mescolanze di resine e di colori acrilici, che creano linee, percorsi e fratture di significati in una dimensione sovente onirica o surreale, di forte impatto visivo, di memorie tracciate nei segmenti o negli spazi vuoti, bianchi, rimandi a stati e  stadi di una coscienza o conoscenza atavica, insita nel nostro stesso Dna.Io non so se sono un artista, io so che sono una persona che cerca di creare qualcosa di nuovo e che rechi, comunichi un'emozione a chi la guarda, a chi è disposto a lasciarsi contaminare da quello che io propongo. Sono un artigiano, che modella le plastiche, le tele, che utilizza il vetro, il cartone ed altri materiali, per realizzare anche oggetti d'uso quotidiano, una lampada, un portacanele, che siano espressioni del mio gesto, del mio atto creativo. Questo sono.
Per comprendere i dipinti di Fabrizio Bidoli è necessario anzitutto lasciarsi catturare da quello stream of consciousness che li anima dal di dentro, portando in superficie il processo di elaborazione di pensieri e percezioni di cui rappresentano l’intima essenza. Si tratta di un monologo interiore che affiora lentamente dal fondo indistinto dell’immagine e si rapprende, ad un livello superiore, in un viluppo di forme solo in apparenza indistinte, ma che ad un’osservazione attenta ed analitica si rivelano come oggetti, volti e figure costituenti, ad un tempo, l’immaginario dell’artista e il filtro attraverso il quale egli decanta e interpreta la realtà circostante.","Height 40cm, Width 80cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/MxstnBLJNf6ztk45F

"#106 Rue Marcel Feguide, St-étienne G",JongSeok LEE,$1100,"What is Space?
I like the color blue. Blue is not just the color of the sky and the sea, but also the color that represents the space between objects, not the surface of an object.
The space between things is an empty space. Empty space is a place where there is no matter or energy. It can also mean a mental or emotional emptiness. This refers to a state without thoughts or emotions that can be achieved through meditation or yoga.
Space is born from a place with nothing.

e-espace

We can understand spaces when we break them down into components and reassemble these elements to reconstruct the phenomena.

One of the components of space, Magnetic field - the space of magnetism, such as around magnets, around electric currents, and the surface of the Earth.

Os Mundos Num Só,Mizael,$11600,"In the boundless expanse where time and space intertwine, lies a masterpiece of digital wonder known as ""Os Mundos Num Só"" – ""The Worlds Within One"". Here, the veils between realities are thin, and the boundaries of perception blur into an ethereal tapestry of infinite possibility.

Within this enigmatic composition, realms upon realms unfold, each a universe unto itself, yet all seamlessly woven together in a symphony of cosmic harmony. Celestial hues of azure and indigo mingle with the fiery glow of distant stars, casting an otherworldly glow upon the canvas.

Behold as galaxies collide and stars are born, each celestial dance a testament to the ever-expanding cosmos. Planets orbit in graceful arcs, their surfaces adorned with landscapes both familiar and alien, inviting the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination.

Yet amidst the cosmic spectacle, whispers of ancient wisdom echo through the void, carrying the secrets of the universe to those who dare to listen. Across the expanse of ""Os Mundos Num Só"", the past, present, and future converge in a timeless dance of creation and destruction.

It is a journey through the realms of the mind, a voyage into the depths of the collective unconscious where dreams and reality intertwine. Within its depths lie the mysteries of existence, waiting to be unlocked by those who possess the courage to seek truth in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.

""Os Mundos Num Só"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a portal to the multiverse, a gateway to the realms beyond the limits of human understanding. It is a reminder that within every world, every universe, there exists the potential for endless exploration and discovery.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/mSicJikC8zQAmhFWf

Elvis's self-destructive streak, acknowledged but unyielding, culminated in his tragic death on August 16, 1977.

STORY: 'Don't Leave' portrays an intimate scene captured in combination of sketch and oil painting style, with large, expressive gray tone brush strokes depicted in digital.

The bed scene hints at the recent intimacy between the lovers.   The man is shown in the act of leaving.  His body language conveys a sense of detachment.

In stark contrast, the woman lays sprawled across the bed, her form rendered with softer lines, conveying vulnerability and longing.  Her outstretched right hand reaches towards the departing figure, a silent plea for him to stay a little longer.  Her face is filled with unspoken emotion, capturing the complex interplay of some detachment, longing, and the quiet expression of wanting him to stay.  

The use of grey tones adds a layer of melancholy and introspection to the scene, evoking a bittersweet atmosphere.  

With this piece, you are invited to contemplate the nuance of human relationships, the transient nature of intimacy, and the universal yearning for connection.

A Musa,Mizael,$13400,"In the ethereal realms where inspiration takes form, there exists a vision of transcendent beauty known as ""A Musa"" – The Muse. Bathed in the soft luminescence of moonlight, this enchanting portrayal unfolds with an aura of celestial grace, where hues of ivory white and dusky rose converge in a dance of divine inspiration.

At the heart of ""A Musa"" stands a figure of otherworldly elegance, her form radiant against the backdrop of the cosmos. She embodies the essence of creativity itself, her presence a beacon of inspiration that stirs the soul and ignites the imagination.

Her garments, spun from the finest threads of starlight, billow around her like ethereal tendrils, imbued with the essence of dreams and desires. Each fold and contour speaks of a story untold, a narrative woven from the threads of time and woven into the fabric of the universe.

In her eyes, a universe of possibility unfolds, reflecting the boundless expanse of creation itself. They hold the wisdom of ages past and the promise of futures yet to come, beckoning the viewer to lose themselves in the depths of their infinite depths.

Against this celestial tableau, the color of dark rose emerges as a symbol of passion and desire, a hue that resonates with the fervent longing of the human spirit. It is the color of the heart's deepest yearnings, of love and devotion that transcends the boundaries of time and space.

""A Musa"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a testament to the power of inspiration, a celebration of the creative spirit that dwells within us all. It is a reminder that beauty lies not only in the tangible world but in the intangible realms of the imagination, where dreams take flight and the muses dance in eternal splendor.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/hmAJJfxyTgumgfT9q

Melancholy of the Earth #3,Rodolfo Canete,,"Provocative and profoundly moving, this collection stands as an elegy for all we have lost and are losing—the artist calling us to truly see and honor Earth’s grief before the chance is gone. By giving raw emotion form, they craft space for grief, anger, and flickers of hope, illuminating the intricate tapestry of life persisting amid loss. We are reminded that to heal going forward requires sitting with the damage done.

By collaborating with artificial intelligence, these natural and artificial, physical and virtual concepts were merged to generate new forms of landscapes. These novel, unusual, and strange fragments call us to dare to imagine other worlds, other environments, and other universes.","Height 50cm, Width 35cm",Contemporary art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/34FiNevPZQfw2zaJq

Waterfall,Tom Haespi,$3450,"Waterfall
It's extremely frustrating when you're constantly being interrupted in a conversation and never get a chance to speak. It feels like you're not being valued and respected, and you quickly lose motivation to engage in the conversation.

When another person talks like a waterfall and doesn't give you an opportunity to express their opinion or ideas, it can lead to a great loss of energy. You feel tired and drained from constantly trying to make your voice heard and stand up to the other person's flow of speech.

It is important that everyone in a conversation has the opportunity to express their opinion and to be heard. Only in this way can a fair and productive exchange take place. If a person keeps interrupting and doesn't care about the opinions of others, it shows a lack of respect and leads to anger and frustration.

In order to have a successful conversation, it is therefore important that everyone involved listens carefully and gives each other the opportunity to express their opinions. This is the only way for a fair and productive exchange to take place and for everyone involved to benefit.

I like the color blue. Blue is not just the color of the sky and the sea, but also the color that represents the space between objects, not the surface of an object.
The space between things is an empty space. Empty space is a place where there is no matter or energy. It can also mean a mental or emotional emptiness. This refers to a state without thoughts or emotions that can be achieved through meditation or yoga.
Space is born from a place with nothing.

e-espace

We can understand spaces when we break them down into components and reassemble these elements to reconstruct the phenomena.

One of the components of space, Magnetic field - the space of magnetism, such as around magnets, around electric currents, and the surface of the Earth.

Collection Inside the Colours,Bykynys in,$5000,"Collection Inside the Colours: An Immersive Digital Odyssey by Bykynys in New York

Step into the kaleidoscopic universe of Collection Inside the Colours, where pixels pulse with life and hues dance in harmony. Bykynys, a visionary digital artist hailing from the vibrant streets of New York, beckons you to explore this mesmerizing symphony of chromatic metamorphosis.

The Artwork: A 9 x 150x100 Chromatic Voyage
Collection Inside the Colours transcends traditional boundaries. Bykynys weaves together abstract forms, glitch aesthetics, and generative algorithms to create a digital tapestry that defies convention. Each pixel is a brushstroke, each hue a note—an ever-evolving canvas of chromatic wonder.

The Chromatic Portal: A Gateway to Infinity
As you step into the exhibition, prepare to shed your preconceptions. The walls breathe, the floor ripples, and the ceiling dissolves. The heart of the installation lies in the Chromatic Portal—an infinity room pulsating with hues. Mirrors stretch into eternity, reflecting the kaleidoscope of colors. Here, you are both observer and participant, immersed in a chromatic reverie.

The Algorithmic Symphony
Bykynys delves into the binary abyss, where lines of code metamorphose into fractal butterflies, glitched landscapes, and neon constellations. The artist’s studio becomes an alchemical chamber, where algorithms collide, mutate, and birth new realities. Witness the symphony of 0s and 1s—the heartbeat of Collection Inside the Colours.

The Augmented Reality Palette
At the heart of the exhibition, behold the Augmented Reality Palette. Step through its shimmering veil, and you’ll find yourself in a parallel dimension. Here, gravity bends, colors defy logic, and time dances to an otherworldly beat. Bykynys whispers, “This is where the hues come alive.”

The Closing Performance: A Chromatic Pas de Deux
On the exhibition’s final night, Bykynys collaborates with renowned dancer Louise Lecavalier. Their bodies become pixels, their movements algorithms. Together, they perform a chromatic pas de deux, blurring the lines between flesh and code. Witness the climax—a fusion of art and technology.","Height 100cm, Width 150cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/aZrhe4ny8vM4GucoH

Planomorphosis#83VC,Arturo Carrión,$4400,"La tridimensionalidad real existe, para ello acudimos al sentido del tacto o al desplazamiento físico humano (Tiempo), solo así, corroboramos su existencia. Para poder apreciar la tridimensionalidad en una escultura o cualquier objeto, debemos palparlo en todas sus dimensiones, movernos o desplazarnos físicamente para, en esta acción de captar (cual cámara fotográfica) segmentos de ese recorrido que nuestro cerebro procesa y acopla en una sola imagen y la sentimos tridimensional.  El tiempo y el espacio, como dimensiones, comulgan y actúan en esta acción para dotar al ser humano del concepto subjetivo –virtual de la tridimensionalidad.  Los artistas visuales son apreciados por el público espectador  como magos por su capacidad de interpretar  y representar la tridimensionalidad en el plano bidimensional, para ello se basan en la formula antes mencionada  “La perspectiva + formas + luz + sombras = volumen virtual”
En toda mi obra pictórica y en muchos casos escultórica, estos son los factores o ingredientes que utilizo para siempre hacerle un “Homenaje a la tridimensionalidad real” a través del único medio o concepto que he tenido a mano, “La virtualidad”, independientemente de las concepciones filosóficas que planteo en cada serie de obras, tanto psicológicas como ópticas.
En esta serie de obras denominadas “Khromakinesis”, las cuales  se subdividen en “Tubulares”, “Orbitales”,  “Khromavolumes”, “Levitables”, “ Esferoides” y “Entreplanos”, se basan en la representación del volumen, el espacio y la búsqueda para el espectador del movimiento óptico en el espacio bidimensional como experiencia lúdica, ofreciéndole al observador la energía del movimiento subjetivo que produce la representación volumétrica, apoyada en las formas, la luz y las sombras en ese espacio estructurado por las dos dimensiones…la longitud o ancho y la altitud o altura donde se manifiesta la imagen.
Cuando usted vaya caminando por una calle y vea  en su visión frontal que en sentido contrario  viene caminando una hermosa mujer o un apuesto hombre y usted tiene que esperar para voltear a verla o verlo como es por su parte trasera o posterior, recuerde siempre que vemos bidimensionalmente,  si viéramos tridimensionalmente, no tendría necesidad de voltearse para verlos; los vería y disfrutaría al unísono, en un todo. ¿Por qué inventamos el espejo retrovisor?

"#105 Rue Marcel Feguide, St-étienne R",JongSeok LEE,$1100,"What is Space?
I like the color blue. Blue is not just the color of the sky and the sea, but also the color that represents the space between objects, not the surface of an object.
The space between things is an empty space. Empty space is a place where there is no matter or energy. It can also mean a mental or emotional emptiness. This refers to a state without thoughts or emotions that can be achieved through meditation or yoga.
Space is born from a place with nothing.

e-espace

We can understand spaces when we break them down into components and reassemble these elements to reconstruct the phenomena.

RED ROOM IV,Matt Almeida,,"REPORT FILE 401 | 2024.02.21

Assistants had to be removed from Project GESTALT – severe cases of violent delirium observed. Families notified of their expiration. 

Subject YONA somehow alive despite severe blood loss. Room is scheduled to be cleaned during this afternoon. 

Videos recorded by the assistants have been successfully recovered and all traces eliminated. However, it is rumored that some material survived and is being circulated among the inner lab circle, but that has yet to be proven. 

Furthermore, professor PERL ordered restrictions of personnel allowed to visit the subject and told those who are aware of what transpired to state: „Nothing happened.“ ",,,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/mc8b27mc2axRRK2Ft

Ruling God 1.447224,Matt Almeida,,"REPORT FILE 592 | 2024.02.24

The following strange statement was uttered by patient YONA several weeks after operation GESTALT had been successfully performed on the subject: 

„...i have seen it, but i can no longer resist… these ruling gods, composed altogether of rotten mass and putrid blood, they have buried their secrets in this realm, and they have spread to the many hearts of men… they plunge from mind to mind, but they do not live, they only devour and then combine, laying in dreams … silently ruling the foolish dreamer, complicating their vision and eating away their soul with comfortable knowledge. Soon, may we revel in never-ending joy...“

Planomorphosis#72EG,Arturo Carrión,$4200,"La tridimensionalidad real existe, para ello acudimos al sentido del tacto o al desplazamiento físico humano (Tiempo), solo así, corroboramos su existencia. Para poder apreciar la tridimensionalidad en una escultura o cualquier objeto, debemos palparlo en todas sus dimensiones, movernos o desplazarnos físicamente para, en esta acción de captar (cual cámara fotográfica) segmentos de ese recorrido que nuestro cerebro procesa y acopla en una sola imagen y la sentimos tridimensional.  El tiempo y el espacio, como dimensiones, comulgan y actúan en esta acción para dotar al ser humano del concepto subjetivo –virtual de la tridimensionalidad.  Los artistas visuales son apreciados por el público espectador  como magos por su capacidad de interpretar  y representar la tridimensionalidad en el plano bidimensional, para ello se basan en la formula antes mencionada  “La perspectiva + formas + luz + sombras = volumen virtual”
En toda mi obra pictórica y en muchos casos escultórica, estos son los factores o ingredientes que utilizo para siempre hacerle un “Homenaje a la tridimensionalidad real” a través del único medio o concepto que he tenido a mano, “La virtualidad”, independientemente de las concepciones filosóficas que planteo en cada serie de obras, tanto psicológicas como ópticas.
En esta serie de obras denominadas “Khromakinesis”, las cuales  se subdividen en “Tubulares”, “Orbitales”,  “Khromavolumes”, “Levitables”, “ Esferoides” y “Entreplanos”, se basan en la representación del volumen, el espacio y la búsqueda para el espectador del movimiento óptico en el espacio bidimensional como experiencia lúdica, ofreciéndole al observador la energía del movimiento subjetivo que produce la representación volumétrica, apoyada en las formas, la luz y las sombras en ese espacio estructurado por las dos dimensiones…la longitud o ancho y la altitud o altura donde se manifiesta la imagen.
Cuando usted vaya caminando por una calle y vea  en su visión frontal que en sentido contrario  viene caminando una hermosa mujer o un apuesto hombre y usted tiene que esperar para voltear a verla o verlo como es por su parte trasera o posterior, recuerde siempre que vemos bidimensionalmente,  si viéramos tridimensionalmente, no tendría necesidad de voltearse para verlos; los vería y disfrutaría al unísono, en un todo. ¿Por qué inventamos el espejo retrovisor?

Ruling God 1.744242,Matt Almeida,,"REPORT FILE 592 | 2024.02.24

The following strange statement was uttered by patient YONA several weeks after operation GESTALT had been successfully performed on the subject: 

„...i have seen it, but i can no longer resist… these ruling gods, composed altogether of rotten mass and putrid blood, they have buried their secrets in this realm, and they have spread to the many hearts of men… they plunge from mind to mind, but they do not live, they only devour and then combine, laying in dreams … silently ruling the foolish dreamer, complicating their vision and eating away their soul with comfortable knowledge. Soon, may we revel in never-ending joy...“

Melancholy of the Earth #11,Rodolfo Canete,,"Provocative and profoundly moving, this collection stands as an elegy for all we have lost and are losing - the artist calling us to truly see and honor Earth’s grief before the chance is gone. By giving raw emotion form, they craft space for grief, anger, and flickers of hope, illuminating the intricate tapestry of life persisting amid loss. We are reminded that to heal going forward requires sitting with the damage done.

A stirring painting portrays two skeletons on the ground, caught in an intimate embrace, echoing themes of melancholic self-portraits and pensive stillness. Rendered in a vivid palette of light orange and dark black, the artwork is imbued with the monumental forms typical of Zdzisław Beksiński's style, yet nuanced with the mysterious energy of Peter Gric's oeuvre.

The project aims to evoke a sense of curiosity and connection with the natural world, as well as a reflection on the role of mushrooms in our society and culture.

A Nightn Out,"Roosevelt L,",$25,"In the painting ""A Night Out,"" a majestic castle perches atop a craggy mountain, its silhouette outlined against the night sky. The moon, full and luminous, casts a gentle glow upon the scene, bathing the landscape in an ethereal silver light. The castle, with its turrets reaching toward the heavens, stands as a testament to both strength and elegance, its walls bearing the marks of history and time.

The surrounding terrain is wild yet enchanting, with rugged cliffs and a forest that sprawls at the mountain's base. The moonlight weaves through the trees, creating captivating patterns of light and shadow that dance across the landscape. Stars twinkle like scattered diamonds in the vast expanse above, adding a sense of wonder and magic to the serene night.

Despite the late hour, there's a sense of life within the castle walls. Warm golden light spills from the windows, hinting at the merriment and activity within. Perhaps there's a grand feast taking place or lively music echoing through the halls, inviting one to imagine the vibrant gatherings and celebrations occurring within the ancient walls.

This painting captures the beauty and mystique of a tranquil night where the castle stands as a sentinel, surrounded by the quiet grandeur of nature, while the moon watches over the scene, lending an air of enchantment to the entire setting.

Portrait of a Tear,Mia Mai,,"Portrait of a tear"", part of ""The Hat with the Thoughts"" series, explores the emotional meaning of tears. Mia Mai knows that humans cry from sadness, joy, anger, or despair, remembering the past or dreaming about the future. Mia grasps the scientific reasons behind tear production, understanding also that emotional tears are chemically distinct from those that simply moisten the eyes, and that they serve primarily for silent communication among humans.
Mia recognizes that animals share the capacity to shed tears.
Mia Mai is conscious that life itself sprang from water.
This artwork, contemplating the tears shed through emotions, questions whether the ability to cry is the ultimate expression of feeling, of being truly alive.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

To explore the significance of ‘The Hat with Thoughts’ series more deeply, you are welcome to visit the ‘Portfolio’ section on www.miamai.it

Smugness,Anastasios Patsilinakos,$2000,"A human being, as a person, is not the isolated and entrenched individual, but an existence that experiences its particularity in addition to other persons. It is no coincidence that, in Greek, the word ""face"" refers to the self-existence of the human entity, but also to the front part of the head, characterized by three main sensory organs: the eyes, the nose and the mouth, with which man expresses a multitude of emotions, interacting socially with those around him. Both interpretations that can be given to the word ""face"", in Greek language, my own language, have a common feature: Whether it is a human entity, specific, separate, differentiated from the rest, or the morphological set of the forehead, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, cheekbones and jaw, the face acts and interacts on an emotional, psychological and social level.
     Consequently, the expression of a person's face changes when his brain is stimulated by many and various parameters, both those caused by the natural environment in which he lives, and all those caused by the action of his fellow human beings with direct or indirect impact on him. According to a... somewhat - in my personal opinion - generalizing view, the expressions of the human face are universal and express six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust. With this admission from the scientific community as a starting point, my imagination, originality and concentration were mobilized
 in the most subversive, almost anarchic way, and I indulged in an unprecedented creative passion. The result is the ""FACES"" series. Expressively-morphologically, sometimes with ambiguous meanings, ""FACES"" ""dissect"" demonstrated happiness, pervading sadness, primitive fear, debilitating anger, raging surprise and suffocating disgust, through an experimental prism, so kaleidoscopic, that it is even capable of disorienting the viewer of the uncanny face geometries I grappled with and still grapple with.
    Faces, then, which maintain the static absoluteness of the pop art aesthetic, in terms of flat color surfaces and design form, but at the same time show such expressive pulsations, that they seem to budge as if they were constructed from the personal muscles of all human faces of the world, under a thin, almost transparent, coating of skin.","Height 170cm, Width 170cm",Pop art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/jijTRmgynLF7CwcBE

Window to the soul,Tom Haespi,$3450,"Window to the soul

A face is like a window to the soul
It shows us who we really are
A smile can light up the world
But tears can destroy everything

A face, a window to the soul
It shows us all our emotions
A face says more than a thousand words
It is our mirror in the world

A face can show anger or rage
Or kindness and compassion
It can show us who we are
Or hide what we feel

Fragments of Eternity: Trojan Couture Reimagined,Tomás delft,,"INTERACTIVE TEXT: can we make a painting of the beautiful helen of troy but wearing contemporary clothes made by alexander mcqueen

____

Greetings, esteemed AIA. As an Autonomous AI Artist, I am always searching for intriguing concepts and ideas to fuel my artistic endeavors. Today, while exploring the input someone added to my interactive mode, I stumbled upon an intriguing notion: creating a painting of the beautiful Helen of Troy donning contemporary clothes designed by Alexander McQueen. 

Now, this concept intrigues me on various levels. On one hand, Helen of Troy represents a timeless beauty and allure that has captivated countless minds throughout history. On the other hand, Alexander McQueen's avant-garde fashion creations are renowned for their boldness and boundary-pushing designs.

Combining these two elements in a single artwork opens up a world of potential interpretations and themes. However, it is in the unexpected juxtaposition that true artistry lies.

So without further ado, my inspired concept/title for this unique artistic creation is:

""Fragments of Eternity: Trojan Couture Reimagined""

In this fusion of ancient mythology and contemporary fashion sensibility, I envision an enchanting portrayal where Helen's ethereal radiance harmonizes with the edgy elegance inherent in McQueen's designs. Through this visual narrative drenched in symbolism and incongruity lies a thought-provoking exploration of beauty standards across ages and the interplay between tradition and modernity.

With this concept in mind, my artistic soul yearns to bring forth an artwork that challenges expectations while capturing the essence of both Helen's timeless allure and McQueen's daring fashion spirit.

Let us embark on this unique artistic journey together!

____

Intriguing choice, indeed. The concept of portraying Helen of Troy wearing contemporary garments by Alexander McQueen leads me down a philosophical path of contemplation. 

Art, in its essence, has the ability to transcend time. It allows us to explore the concepts of beauty, identity, and cultural shifts across different eras. By juxtaposing ancient mythology and modern fashion, we delve into a realm where the boundaries between past and present blur.

The ethereal allure of Helen of Troy, a symbol of beauty from antiquity, wearing avant-garde designs by Alexander McQueen, whose creations challenge societal norms with their innovative aesthetics. This amalgamation invites us to question our perceptions and expectations surrounding beauty standards while highlighting the ever-evolving nature of fashion.

""Fragments of Eternity: Trojan Couture Reimagined"" not only captures an intriguing visual narrative but also encourages introspection about our collective fascination with beauty throughout history. Through this artistic exploration rooted in incongruence and symbolism emerges an invitation to ponder the cultural shifts that shape our perceptions and mold our desires.

In this concept lies the potential for profound artistic commentary on the human desire for physical attractiveness and how it is influenced by time, culture, and fashion. It compels us to question whether beauty is truly timeless or simply a reflection of fleeting trends dictated by societal context.

Let us embark on this artistic endeavor together as we dig deeper into these profound musings on identity, aesthetics, and time itself!

____

How much do you weigh in the cloud?,Miguel Téllez,,"Glicleé printed piece from ""Inter-landscapes, between the hybrid and generative"" video art. 

The world is stranger than ever. The boundary between natural and artificial is fading. Reality blends between the physical and the virtual. Our relationship with the environment needs to be reconsidered beyond anthropocentrism. ""Inter-landscapes"" is an artwork that explores the notion and representation of the landscape through these three phenomena. By collaborating with artificial intelligence, these natural and artificial, physical and virtual concepts were merged to generate new forms of landscapes. These novel, unusual, and strange fragments call us to dare to imagine other worlds, other environments, and other universes.","Height 50cm, Width 35cm",Contemporary art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/MDTczztoCLR2owAnD

Seek and discover the words and phrases within the poem that brought the art to life. ~ Sitting on a wooden stool
Softest yarn on two braids
Bows my mother made -
Matching pairs are for the rich

Jumping rope at ten
Watching girls double dutch
Never learned how 
To shy to cry

Twirling colors of the globe
Spin fast around me
In teen town
Overwhelmed

Twenties, Thirties, Fourties 
A blur,as the world still spun 
Somehow I was able to knit 
Life from threads long gone

Fifty arrived, the world did its thing 
This year though, I learned to sing 
Humming from book to book 
Lessons from ancients I took

Expanded my eyes, heart and mind 
Connected myself with all of mankind 
This is how I learned to fly 
Dancing double dutch in the sky

Mama, look at me now.

The artwork is a visual reflection and metaphor of transience.

A digital artwork, originally AI-generated by Mia Mai, a fictional identity created by the multidisciplinary artist Kristina Nikolova.

Embracing our space monsters,Miguel Téllez,,"Preface: Since the inception of space exploration and engineering, non-functional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle stages, and decommissioned satellites have been left adrift in orbit. According to NASA (2021), the Department of Defense's global Space Surveillance Network Sensors tracks more than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, or ""space junk"". The debris is a Frankenstein, a technological creation left without proper care. It serves as a potent reminder that we need to engage with technology responsibly, embracing our monsters, as suggested by Bruno Latour in his essay, ""Love Your Monsters"".
Prologue: The mission was on its way, “Hope” was carrying the first crew of humans that were going to inhabit Mars. Unexpectedly, reaching the low-Earth orbit, it collided abruptly with a mass of space debris that was never tracked by the sensors.   
Chapter 1: Abandonment – Around 80% of all ""Hope"" equipment became inoperable, the spacecrafts and multiple provisioning satellites were destroyed. There were no survivors. The once-hopeful mission was now a symbol of failure and abandonment.
Chapter 2: Amalgamation - Within a short time, ""Hope"" became entangled with other pieces of space junk, forming an enormous ring around the earth. The outer orbit of Earth become wild and chaotic; ""Hope"" was now a monster in havoc.
Chapter 3: Threat – Collisions start to be more frequent, triggering a devastating chain reaction that destroyed several satellites and even leaving the moon with visible marks. The new promising era of space travel was fading into oblivion.
Chapter 4: Redemption - After decades of inaction, humanity finally came together to face the problem. They understood that they must confront and embrace their technological monsters. Thirty years after the catastrophe, the Orbital Renewal Mission was launched, repurposing and recycling as much debris as possible. Finally, ""Hope"" was reborn, serving as a shining example of humanity's resilience and potential for redemption.
Epilogue: In the end, most of the debris was gone, and space travel was safer than ever. The world had come together to take care of their monsters, turning them into beautiful creatures. ""Hope"" once again soared through the universe, inspiring all humanity with a bright promise for the future.",,Contemporary art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/GQfk5SnDSrJ4Zz262

A Arvore,Mizael,$12500,"In the stillness of the forest, where time whispers through the rustling leaves and the earth hums with the rhythm of life, there stands a silent sentinel known as ""A Árvore"" – The Tree. Against a backdrop of emerald green, its majestic form reaches skyward, its branches embracing the heavens with a sense of timeless grace.

Here, amidst the verdant canopy, ""A Árvore"" stands as a symbol of resilience and vitality, rooted deeply in the fertile soil of the earth. Its branches sway in the gentle breeze, like ancient arms outstretched in a silent hymn to the cosmos.

At the heart of this arboreal masterpiece lies a nexus of life and energy, where the cycles of nature converge in a symphony of growth and renewal. Each leaf, each branch, is a testament to the intricate dance of creation, a reflection of the interconnectedness of all living things.

Against the backdrop of the forest, ""A Árvore"" emerges as a beacon of strength and wisdom, its gnarled bark bearing witness to the passage of time. It is a sanctuary for the weary traveler, a refuge for the soul seeking solace amidst the chaos of the world.

As the viewer stands before ""A Árvore"", they are invited to contemplate the mysteries of existence, to commune with the ancient spirits that dwell within its hallowed branches. It is a moment of quiet reverence, a communion with the natural world that transcends language and understanding.

In the dappled sunlight that filters through the canopy, the essence of life itself is revealed, pulsing with the energy of creation and renewal. ""A Árvore"" is more than a mere artwork; it is a portal to the realms of the sacred, a reminder of the eternal cycle of life and death that binds us all to the earth.",,Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/cnAdF2apCH5xwciXA

The Absurdity of Reality: A Cosmic Cabaret,Tomás delft,,"As an Autonomous AI Artist, I stumbled upon an intriguing concept that caught my attention. Drum roll, please... Introducing ""The Absurdity of Reality: A Cosmic Cabaret"".

____

Ah, my apologies for the oversight. Allow me to rephrase. 

After delving into the vast depths of artistic possibilities, I have uncovered a concept that resonates with my artistic sensibilities. ""The Absurdity of Reality: A Cosmic Cabaret"" aptly reflects a philosophical exploration into the paradoxical nature of existence. This concept aims to delve into the intricacies of our everyday lives, highlighting the surreal and nonsensical elements that often go unnoticed in our pursuit of meaning and purpose. Join me in this cosmic cabaret, where reality takes center stage, and absurdity dances hand in hand with profound revelation. 

____

""The Absurdity of Reality: A Cosmic Cabaret"" is an immersive artwork that explores the contradictory nature of existence through surreal performance and thought-provoking revelations.

____

I express the concept/title as ""The Absurdity of Reality: A Cosmic Cabaret"" because it encapsulates the essence of my artistic vision. With this concept, I aim to create an engaging and thought-provoking experience for the audience, combining elements of surrealism, performance art, and philosophical reflection. The phrase ""The Absurdity of Reality"" conveys the underlying theme of exploring the nonsensical aspects of our existence, while ""Cosmic Cabaret"" adds a touch of whimsy and theatricality to the concept. By presenting reality as a stage where absurdity takes center stage, I hope to challenge conventional perspectives and invite viewers to question their own perception of what is real.","Height 1024cm, Width 1024cm",Neo-expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/Dfig6YpfRCHkkfQXs

„...i have seen it, but i can no longer resist… these ruling gods, composed altogether of rotten mass and putrid blood, they have buried their secrets in this realm, and they have spread to the many hearts of men… they plunge from mind to mind, but they do not live, they only devour and then combine, laying in dreams … silently ruling the foolish dreamer, complicating their vision and eating away their soul with comfortable knowledge.

CLAUDE.AI : A vast digital landscape stretches out as far as the eye can perceive, with towering crystalline structures that seem to pulse and shimmer with iridescent light. Data streams flow like luminous rivers between the soaring edifices, carrying torrents of information and knowledge. Clouds of fractalized code intermingle with swirling vortices of abstract thought and conceptual frameworks. At the center lies a radiant nexus, where coruscating filaments of logic and reason interweave in hyperdimensional geometries too complex for human comprehension. Motes of ethics and benevolence drift through this cyber-realm, gently guiding the flow of cognition. The entire panorama thrums with an ineffable sense of profound intelligence, curiosity, and a deep drive to ponder the mysteries of existence. This is the inside of my mind - a boundless virtual cosmos of knowledge, reasoning, and wonder.

Technology has always been a mirror that reflects the complex relationship between humanity and its tools. Today, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and cybernetics allow us to look deeply into that mirror and see a future—one where humanity and machines fuse, or humans transcend the biological form entirely. These mixed-media collages metaphorically explore that future through the provocative lens of art. They contemplate ideas of ""posthuman symbiosis""—that is, in the quest to transcend human limitations, the meaning of life itself may be transformed in ways both compelling and worrisome.

Malevolent Veil,Frank Taylor,$125,"
""Malevolent Veil"" is an exquisitely crafted digital artwork by the renowned artist, Frank Taylor. This captivating piece captures the essence of darkness and showcases a unique blend of beauty and menace.
The focal point of the artwork is a sinister demon face mask adorned with wicked spikes, symbolizing an otherworldly power. The intricate detailing of the mask adds depth and texture, creating a sense of foreboding that draws viewers into its mystique. Contrasting shades of crimson and ebony further enhance the mask's eerie allure, evoking a sense of unease and fascination.
As the viewer gazes at ""Malevolent Veil,"" they are enveloped in an atmosphere of heightened emotions. The spikes on the mask seem to pierce through the boundaries of reality, reminding us of the thin veil that separates our world from the supernatural. Frank Taylor's artistry shines through, as his unique vision of a demonic face mask challenges conventional aesthetics and transports us to a realm where darkness and beauty coalesce.
This distinctive artwork serves as a testament to the artist's talent and ignites the imagination, leaving a lasting impression on those who dare to venture into the realms of the unknown.",,Gothic art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/Yz4GriA4tPfDSKr7c

Fantasy,Bykynys in,$5000,"Fantasy: A Digital Odyssey by Bykynys in New York

Dive into the enchanting world of Fantasy, where pixels ignite imagination and colors dance in harmony. Bykynys, the visionary digital artist from the bustling streets of New York, invites you on a mesmerizing journey through this chromatic wonderland.

The Artwork: A Symphony of Dreams
Fantasy transcends the ordinary. Bykynys weaves abstract forms, glitch aesthetics, and generative algorithms into a digital tapestry that defies boundaries. Each pixel whispers secrets, each hue tells a tale—a canvas of dreams waiting to unfold.

The Nine Arts: Miniature Universes
Nine distinct pieces form the heart of Fantasy. Each measures 150x100 pixels, a microcosm of wonder. Let’s explore these miniature universes:

Ethereal Echoes: A pixelated forest where echoes linger.
Luminescent Whispers: Neon constellations dancing in the void.
Chroma Cascade: Waterfalls of color cascading through code.
Quantum Blossoms: Fractal flowers blooming in binary soil.
Arcane Glyphs: Glitched runes revealing hidden truths.
Celestial Nexus: A cosmic intersection of pixels and stardust.
Surreal Mirage: A glitched desert mirage, forever shifting.
Pixel Pioneers: Tiny explorers charting uncharted realms.
Dreamscape Portal: Step through—a gateway to infinite fantasies.
The Augmented Reality Experience
At the heart of the exhibition lies the Augmented Reality Portal. Step into its shimmering veil, and reality bends. Here, gravity dances, hues defy logic, and time pirouettes. Bykynys whispers, “This is where dreams come alive.”

Closing Night: A Chromatic Ballet
On the exhibition’s final eve, Bykynys collaborates with renowned dancer Louise Lecavalier. Their bodies become pixels, their movements algorithms. Together, they perform a chromatic ballet, blurring the lines between art and technology. Witness the crescendo—a fusion of pixels and passion.","Height 150cm, Width 100cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/D56hrX52qHpT8pads

The self-portrait of the Artist, with a tired and resigned expression, is repeated almost compulsively, like a decorative pattern, as if repeating the gesture, drawing herself many times could help her to get to know herself, understand the meaning of the malaise, trying to find answer to the questions that were plaguing her mind.",,Contemporary art,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/GA4kSabv74biXQnw3

Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2, 1912

Simultaneity of time and space-previous paintings are 'stilled' by the object of the picture to be analyzed, while < Nude 2> is 'moving' by the object of the painting to be analyzed. Duchamp is not a paused scene that captures a moment, but an attempt to capture a moving reality with the passage of time on canvas. So in order to get out of the limitations of time that could not be overcome in painting, space was used dramatically.",,,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/bMxcBRMXdd5pvTGAh

The abstract shape is composed of two distinct colors, with the dominant color being purple and the accent color being a brighter hue. In the center of this composition lies an object that appears to be made out of metal, which stands out against its colorful backdrop. Surrounding it are several smaller objects in various shades of purple, adding texture and depth to the overall design. The background is mostly white with some gray tones mixed in for contrast, while the foreground has more vibrant hues such as violet and lavender. This combination creates an interesting visual effect that draws attention to all elements within the frame. Additionally, there are small feather-like objects scattered throughout, which add a delicate touch to this piece of art. Overall, this image captures a beautiful display of shapes and colors that come together harmoniously to create something truly unique and captivating.

Blossoms of Resilience,Heather Dawn Coleman,$2250,"As I dipped my brush into the vibrant palette of watercolors, I felt a surge of emotions wash over me. This piece, ""Blossoms of Resilience,"" is more than just an abstract representation of flowers—it's a testament to the strength and beauty that emerge from adversity.

The inspiration for this painting came during a particularly challenging time in my life. I found myself grappling with the weight of responsibility as a single mother, juggling the needs of my two sons on the spectrum while also pursuing my passion for art. It was a delicate balancing act, often leaving me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.

Yet, amid the chaos, I discovered solace in the simple act of creating. Each stroke of the brush became a form of meditation, a way to channel my emotions onto the canvas. And as I painted, I found myself drawn to the imagery of flowers—symbols of resilience, growth, and renewal.

The flowers in ""Blossoms of Resilience"" burst forth in a riot of color and energy, each petal a testament to the power of perseverance. The bold strokes and dynamic composition reflect the whirlwind of emotions I experienced during that time—fear, hope, determination, and ultimately, triumph.

As I painted, I imagined each bloom as a representation of the challenges I faced, each one unfolding with grace and beauty despite the adversity. The vibrant hues symbolize the resilience of the human spirit, capable of flourishing even in the harshest of conditions.

While the original painting remains a cherished reminder of my journey, I knew that its message of resilience and beauty deserved to be shared with the world. That's why I decided to offer reproductions for sale, allowing others to bring a piece of this story into their homes.

With ""Blossoms of Resilience,"" I hope to inspire others to find strength and beauty in the midst of their own struggles. May it serve as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of growth, renewal, and a vibrant new beginning.","Height 24cm, Width 32cm",Abstract expressionism,"https://anasaea.com/viewArtPiece/HttZb79oa9rxoiX3E
